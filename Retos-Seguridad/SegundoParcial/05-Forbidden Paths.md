# Forbidden Paths

## Descripcion
Can you get the flag? Here's the [website](http://saturn.picoctf.net:55287/). We know that the website files live in `/usr/share/nginx/html/` and the flag is at `/flag.txt` but the website is filtering absolute file paths. Can you get past the filter to read the flag?
